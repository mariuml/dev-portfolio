A portfolio displaying my completed development projects.

## Description

For this project, I delved deeper into how powerful CSS can be. I learnt how to use the grid method and flexbox to position and structure elements on a webpage. 

I learnt the importance of creating responsive layouts so websites can be viewed on a variety of devices. Most importantly, I have now created a landing page for a portfolio that I can add to as my skills progress and I create more projects. 

## Usage

The landing page has been deployed at: (https://mariuml.github.io/horiseon-website/)

Please follow the link to view the final version.

## Credits

This page was built as part of a project for the 'Triology's Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development', an assessed challenge for Module 1.
